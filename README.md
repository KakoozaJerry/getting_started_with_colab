**[Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)** is a free notebook environment that runs entirely in the cloud. You and team members can edit documents the way you work with [Google docs](https://docs.google.com). It supports many popular Machine Learning(**ML**) libraries such as Keras,Tensorflow,Pytorch etc.

More importantly, one can leverage **free Graphics Processing Units**(GPUs) for machine, scientific computing and 3D visualizations. Scientists, Artists and Engineers need access to massively parallel computational power. Deep learning, physical simulation or molecular modelling are accelerated with several **GPU** types such as NVIDIA Tesla K80, P100, P4, T4 and V100 available depending on compute or visualization needs.

My First Notebook
------------------

You will need a Gmail account as Colab implicitly uses Google Drive for storing your notebooks, ensure that you are logged in to your Google Drive account before proceeding further.

Step 1 – Open this URL in your browser.[Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) It will display the following Screen.

Step 7- Click on +Code tab above to create a code cell. 

Congratulations, You just created your first google Colab notebook. Navigate  to the extreme left pane and click on the three lines . Below is the screen that will show.Here you can navigate your notebook easily to various parts of it such as sections.
